# Task: <Human-Readable Task Name>

<!-- One spec file per worker. Be specific — vague specs produce vague results. -->
<!-- The worker reads this file as its primary instruction set. -->

## Objective

<2-3 sentences. What exactly must be accomplished by this worker and nothing more.
Be concrete. "Add a vouchers feature" is bad. "Create the VoucherCard component at
src/shared/components/vouchers/VoucherCard.tsx that renders a Voucher type from
src/types/voucher.types.ts" is good.>

---

## Scope

### Files to Create
- `<path/to/new-file.ts>` — <purpose of this file>
- `<path/to/new-file.tsx>` — <purpose of this file>

### Files to Modify
- `<path/to/existing-file.ts>` — <specifically: what to add, what to change, what NOT to change>
- `<path/to/existing-file.tsx>` — <specifically: what to add>

### Read for Patterns (do NOT modify)
- `<path/to/reference.tsx>` — <what pattern or structure to copy from here>
- `<path/to/types.ts>` — <what types are already defined here>

### Off-Limits (never touch)
- `<path>` — <reason>
- `<path>` — <reason>

## Context

<Background the worker needs to implement this correctly:>

**Data shapes**: The `<TypeName>` type is already defined in `<file>`:
```typescript
// paste the relevant type here so the worker doesn't need to hunt for it
```

**Existing pattern to follow**: See `<reference file>` — the worker should replicate
its structure (imports, component shape, export style, styling approach).

**API / data source**: Data comes from `<source>`. The relevant function/hook is `<name>`.

**Connection points**: This task's output will be consumed by `<other component/screen>`.
The interface must match `<specific requirement>`.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] <Specific, verifiable criterion — can you check this by looking at the code?>
- [ ] <Specific, verifiable criterion>
- [ ] <Specific, verifiable criterion>
- [ ] No TypeScript errors in files within scope (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Follows existing patterns from reference files (no new libraries introduced)
- [ ] All new files have proper named exports

---

## Technical Guidance

- Use `<ExistingComponent>` as the base structural pattern for new components
- Import theme values using `<theming approach, e.g., useTheme() from @shopify/restyle>`
- The data type for `<X>` is `<TypeName>` — already defined at `<path>`
- <Any non-obvious constraint or gotcha workers should know>
- If you need a new dependency, check if something suitable already exists in package.json first

---

## Dependencies

- **Requires output from**: none / `<other-task-slug>`: specifically needs `<what — e.g., "the Voucher type from voucher.types.ts">`
- **Provides to**: none / `<other-task-slug>`: exports `<what — e.g., "VoucherCard component">`

---

## Completion Signal

When **all acceptance criteria are met**, output exactly:
```
<promise><TASK_SLUG>_COMPLETE</promise>
```
And run: `echo "<TASK_SLUG>_COMPLETE" > .claude/.worker-done`

If blocked and unable to continue:
1. Write a BLOCKERS.md file: what you tried, what failed, what input or decision is needed
2. Output: `<promise><TASK_SLUG>_BLOCKED</promise>`
3. Run: `echo "<TASK_SLUG>_BLOCKED" > .claude/.worker-done`
