# Global Claude Code Instructions

## Swarm Integration

When using the swarm system:
- Workers operate in isolated git worktrees — never manually edit files in `../*-worker-*` directories
- Use `/swarm-status` to check progress, not `tmux attach` (unless you want to watch live)
- Always run `/swarm-merge` before `/swarm-test` — test against merged code, not individual branches

## Notes

- Slash commands are defined in `~/.claude/commands/` — edit them to tune behavior
- Re-run setup anytime: `bash ~/.claude/swarm/scripts/setup.sh`
- Add a new command: create `~/.claude/commands/my-command.md` — available immediately
